# Project Title

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot application.

Implemented a QA bot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.
Used Cohere embedding model for efficient embedding generation.
Used Pinecone DB for efficient document embedding storage and retrieval.
Integrated a generative model using Ollama/Llama3 as GPT model.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

A lot has been learned, from installing all the dependancies, understanding the problem statement and solving it with the help of documenation. I got to know more about the RAG application and GenAI and how it can be leveraged for the betterment of the society.
