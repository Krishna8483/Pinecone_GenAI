# Project Title

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot application.

Implemented a QA bot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.
Used Cohere embedding model for efficient embedding generation.
Used Pinecone DB for efficient document embedding storage and retrieval.
Integrated a generative model using Ollama/Llama3 as GPT model.
